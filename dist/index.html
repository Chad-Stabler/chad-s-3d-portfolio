        <p>Welcome to my first three.js project website!</p>

        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>I'm a software engineer out of Saint Louis, MO and a full time gamer, 
          hobbyist fisherman and fellow R/C enjoyer. I have a knack for trying to find 
          creative solutions to problems, I think I picked it up from all the puzzles in 
          The Uncharted games. My personal best fish is an alligator Gar that was around 
          5-1/2 feet long, unfortunately I didn't get to weigh it but it felt like it was pushing
          35+ pounds. My R/C collection consists of one Traxxas X-MAXX 8s and one ARRMA Kraton 6s.
          Whenever I find myself outside I like camping/fishing/float trips and usually get
          dragged into some project that a family member is working on, so I'm used to picking
          up new things to work on all the time.</p>

        <h3>Gaming:</h3>
        <p>
          Ever since I got a playstation 3 along with a copy of Call of Duty: World at War for 
          Christmas at eight years old, I have been inseparable from my gaming consoles or 
          technology in general for that matter. Looking back I see I grew up in an age where 
          there was the first big RAM and graphical boom to the continued rocket growth of 
          complex three-dimensional spaces in games and the amount of data they can load on 
          demand. I grew up playing everything from shooters and RPGs to playing platformers 
          and strategy games. My favorite games include Warframe, Skyrim, Apex Legends and 
          The Crew.

        <h3>Fishing:</h3>
        <p>
          I've been a fisherman for most of my life, from four years old a long time before 
          I discovered video-games and I likely will be for the rest of my life. My most 
          targeted fish currently blue and flathead catfish, but I like catching whatever I 
          can pull out of the water. I haven't been out fishing much this year, but I hope 
          to find more time for it in the future to refine my skills and figure out tactics 
          that catch me big fish more often. My biggest catfish was a twenty three pound blue and I 
          have caught up to a four pound bass.

        <h3>R/C:</h3>
        <p>
          Driving R/C cars has to be one of my youngest hobbies, I didn't pick it up until I 
          was around twelve when I saved up enough of my holiday money to get my first hobby 
          grade truck, the Traxxas Stampede with rear wheel drive, after that I was completely 
          obsessed with getting a four wheel truck to have more fun off road with, enter Traxxas 
          again as they released their biggest and baddest monster truck model, the X-Maxx, 
          it took me a few years to get the courage to save and pull the trigger on such a 
          big purchase, but when I did, I can confidently say it is big, and it is badass. After 
          running through a few years, a couple of battery chargers and three sets of batteries 
          I decided to set out and acquire a new beast, this time on the Arrma Kraton 6s, after 
          purchasing it in April of this year I can say it may be smaller, but it is a beast of 
          it's own right, and I don't know if I could pick between the two.

        <h3>Coding:</h3>
        <p>
          If you haven't noticed this entire website was written and built wy own hands on 
          the keyboard sitting in front of me. I discovered code while studying for general 
          transfer credits at a nearby community college and realized how fun it is and the logic 
          puzzles you get to work with behind it. After discovering I enjoyed it so much I 
          set out to see how I could turn this enjoyable pass time into a career, after a 
          little searching and a recommendation from a family member I found myself in 
          Alchemy Code Lab, a wonderful tech school for those wanting to get into the tech 
          industry. This website is a side project while going through their courses and my 
          first attempt at learning the three.js library. I also threw in an object from a 
          self taught Blender made creation.

        <h3>Final comments:</h3>
        <p>
          I hope you've enjoyed scrolling through this little introduction of me and seeing 
          the few meshes I created with my first three.js website, I definitely enjoyed making 
          it and introducing myself to three-dimensional models and scenes with code. I hope 
          to continue working with three, but it may only be in side projects to a career 
          in software engineering, either way here's the end of my introduction and this 
          little web page, maybe I will expand with time, but for now I hope this was neat 
          enough to peak your interest.
